    "# Basic OFDM Example in Python\n",
    "In this notebook, we will investigate the basic building blocks of an OFDM system at the transmitter and receiver side. OFDM (Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) is a multicarrier system that is applied in a wide range of wireless transmission systems, such as LTE, WiMAX and DVB-T and DAB. The fundamental concept of a multicarrier system is the division of a high-rate transmitted data stream into several low-rate narrow subcarriers. This way, several advantages are obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the symbol duration is inverse proportional to the symbol rate, each subcarrier has relatively long symbols. Long symbols are robust against multipath fading, as it occurs in wireless systems.\n",
    "When a carrier is in a deep fade due to frequency-selectivity of the channel (i.e. the received energy on this carrier is very low), only the data on this subcarrier is lost, instead of the whole stream.\n",
    "Multicarrier systems allow easy multi-user resource sharing by allocating different subcarriers to different users.\n",
    "Consider the following block diagram, which contains fundamental blocks for the OFDM system:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following OFDM example, we will go through each block and describe its operation. However, before let us define some parameters that are used for the OFDM system:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of subcarriers $K$ describes, how many subcarriers are available in the OFDM system.\n"
